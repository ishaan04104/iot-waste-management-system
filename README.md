# IoT Waste Management and Segregation System

The IoT Waste Management and Segregation System is a prototype designed to automate the process of waste segregation and disposal. It incorporates several innovative features to improve waste management efficiency and user experience.

## Features

1. **Automatic Waste Segregation**: The system employs a tilter mechanism and a capacitive soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level of the waste and separate it into dry and wet sections.
2. **Proximity Sensing Lid**: The implementation of a proximity sensing lid mechanism adds convenience and hygiene to waste management by automatically opening the lid when a person is nearby.
3. **Filled-Bin Sensing**: The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect if the bin is full and provides timely alerts through a buzzer and a WhatsApp message to the user.
